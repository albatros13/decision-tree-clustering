# Interpretable decision-tree-based clustering

As a way to solve a problem of finding explainable clusters of class-uniform data in labelled datasets, I experimented with an iterative method to extract high-density clusters with the help of decision-tree-based classifiers. See report at https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08104
